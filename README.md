# QuadMat

Some MATLAB scripts for a drone simulation, can be used via script or simulink (soon)

## Features

* Open loop simulation for a quadcopter model using the space state equations and ode45.
* Plot of X,Y,Z axis values and the drone angles (ϕ, θ, ψ).

## TODO

* Close the loop for **atitude** and **height** control.
* Improve the graphics and the plots.
* Create the simulink blocks that describe the model.
