# QuadMat

Some MATLAB scripts for a drone simulation, can be used via script or simulink.

## Features

* Open loop simulation for a quadcopter model using the space state equations and ode45.
* Plot of X,Y,Z axis values, angles (ϕ, θ, ψ) and input control variation.
* Simulink blocks for the model (needs improving).
* PID optmized by GA on the **height** and **atitude** loops.
* CM extraction.
* Beggining of CACM implementation.
